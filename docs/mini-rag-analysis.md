## Optimization Highlights

### Memory Efficiency Techniques

The implementation utilizes several advanced memory management strategies:

```python
# Lazy loading implementation in embeddings.py
@property
def model(self):
    """Lazy-loaded model property to minimize startup resources."""
    if self._model is None:
        logger.info(f"Loading embedding model: {self.model_name}")
        try:
            self._model = SentenceTransformer(
                self.model_name, 
                device="cpu"
            )
            logger.info("Embedding model loaded successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error loading embedding model: {str(e)}")
            raise
    
    # Update last used time
    self.last_used_time = time.time()
    return self._model
```

```python
# Efficient batch processing in document_processor.py
for i in range(0, len(chunks), batch_size):
    batch_end = min(i + batch_size, len(chunks))
    
    batch_texts = texts[i:batch_end]
    batch_ids = ids[i:batch_end]
    batch_metadatas = metadatas[i:batch_end]
    
    # Generate embeddings for the current batch
    batch_embeddings = self.model.encode(batch)
    all_embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings.tolist())
    
    # Explicitly release memory after each batch
    if i + batch_size < len(texts):
        del batch_embeddings
        gc.collect()
```

### Frontend Performance Optimization

The React implementation incorporates:

```typescript
// Efficient state updates in ChatContext.tsx
const addMessage = (message: Message) => {
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, message]);
};

// Memory-efficient DOM management in MessageList.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
}, [messages, isLoading]);
```

### Backend Resource Management

The backend services implement:

```python
# Resource monitoring in health.py
async def get_resource_metrics() -> ResourceMetrics:
    """Get current system resource utilization metrics."""
    cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=0.1)
    memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
    
    return ResourceMetrics(
        cpu_percent=cpu_percent,
        memory_used_mb=memory.used / (1024 * 1024),
        memory_available_mb=memory.available / (1024 * 1024),
        memory_percent=memory.percent
    )
```
